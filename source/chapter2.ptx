  <title>Exploring Quantum Operations</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this chapter, we are going to use the circuit builder to learn some new quantum operations. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Specifically, we will use the circuit builder to learn about three operations that operate 
      well on qubits in the simple states of |0⟩ and |1⟩: NOT, SWAP, and CNOT.
