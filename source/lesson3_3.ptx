  <title>Phase</title>
  <p>
    <term>Phase</term> is an additional attribute that is relevant when a qubit is in superposition.
    In the last section, you saw that if you have a circuit with two consecutive <c>H</c> gates,
    then the qubit goes into a superposition state after the <em>first</em>
    <c>H</c> gate, but then
    it goes back to its original state after the <em>second</em>
    <c>H</c> gate.
    When in a superposition state, the two qubits have opposite phase.
  </p>

    <p>
      Phase is indicated with a positive or negative sign.   
      If the state <m>\ket{0}</m> goes through an H gate, it has positive phase.
      If the state <m>\ket{1}</m> goes through an H gate, on the other hand, it has negative phase. 
      The <c>H</c> gate creates this superposition by transforming the "basis" states <m>\ket{0}</m> and <m>\ket{1}</m> 
      into equal superpositions of both states, but with opposite phase. We depict this by placing a negative sign in 
      front of the black ball (or <m>\ket{1}</m> state).
    </p>

  </sidebyside>
  <p> Why were positive and negative signs used to indicate phase? It turns out that to calculate the effect of different
  gates, or operations, using the positive and negative signs with existing algebraic rules results in the same answers
  that physicists observe in the real world. Since you already know algebra, then you don't have to learn a whole new set of 
  mathematical operations and symbols to be able to calculate the behavior of quantum systems.  </p>

<p> Now that we have a visual representation of phase, we can have a more complete picture of what the <c>H</c> gate does to a qubit. 
The <c>H</c> gate creates a superposition of the input state, but it also creates a difference in phase between the two states. 
This is why the second <c>H</c> gate can reverse the effect of the first <c>H</c> gate - because it flips the phase back to its original state.

      Now we are going to explore a gate that affects the phase of the qubit.
      Use the following circuit to determine how the <c>Z</c> gate affects a qubit
      that is in the state <m>\ket{0}</m> or <m>\ket{1}</m>. Construct the following two circuits and observe the outputs.
      Remember that to create an input of <m>\ket{1}</m>, you will need to use a <c>NOT</c> gate.

  <p>
    You might have been surprised by the answer! Because quantum state is more complex than merely
    the probability of measuring 0 or 1, this method for determining and expressing an operation's
    functionality is insufficient.
  </p>
  <p> Now, use the circuit builder above to create the following circuits and observe the outcomes.
    This will reveal the functionality of the <c>Z</c> gate on a qubit in superposition.

    Now we see that <c>Z</c> does have a major effect on the system, but <em>only</em> when the
    qubit is in superposition.  The truth table for the <c>Z</c> gate is below. I suggest adding this to your page of notes.
     </p><p>
     <image source="L3.2-Z-gate-truth-table.png" width="25%" />
  </p>
 <p> This truth table does not seem right - you already observed that there is no observable effect
 when a Z gate is applied to a qubit in the <m>\ket{0}</m> or <m>\ket{1}</m> state. So why is the truth table
 expressed this way? We have to remember that the truth table is describing the effect of the Z gate on the full quantum state,
 including phase, not just the measurement outcomes. When a Z gate is applied to a qubit in the <m>\ket{0}</m> or <m>\ket{1}</m> state,
 there is no change in phase, so the effect is not observable. However, when a Z gate is applied to a qubit in superposition, 
 it flips the phase of the states, and the negative sign is always applied to the probability of the <m>\ket{1}</m> state.

    <insert>Insert two circuits for them to calculate the output. Don't do the entanglement gate - just
      some interesting versions of <c>NOT</c>, <c>SWAP</c>, <c>H</c>, and <c>Z</c> to play with going to the 50/50 state
      and
      returning
      to 0,1,
      or the <c>Z</c> gate making it flip. -Diana</insert>
