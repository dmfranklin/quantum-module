<title>Probability</title>
<p> We have now introduced superposition and phase, but we don't have a way of precisely 
    calculating the effects. You know that starting with <m>|0\rangle</m> and applying an H gate 
    places the qubit in positive phase. Likewise, starting with <m>|1\rangle</m> and applying an H gate 
    places the qubit in negative phase. You also know that the Z gate flips the phase. While this is a start, 
    it is not sufficient for calculating the effect of the H and 
    Z gates on more complex states. We first need to have a better understanding of how to calculate 
    probabilities, then use those skills with a mathematical representation to calculate the effects of gates 
    on qubits in states of superposition and 
    phase. </p>
