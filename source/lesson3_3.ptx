  <title>Phase</title>
  <p>
    <term>Phase</term> is an additional attribute that is relevant when a qubit is in superposition.
    In the last section, you saw that if you have a circuit with two consecutive <c>H</c> gates,
    then the qubit goes into a superposition state after the <em>first</em>
    <c>H</c> gate, but then
    it goes back to its original state after the <em>second</em>
    <c>H</c> gate.
    When in a superposition state, the two qubits have opposite phase.
  </p>

  <sidebyside widths="75% 25%" valign="top">
    <p>
      Now we are going to explore a gate that affects the phase of the qubit.
      Use the following circuit to determine how the <c>Z</c> gate affects a qubit
      that is in the state <m>\ket{0}</m> or <m>\ket{1}</m>.

  <p>
    You might have been surprised by the answer! Because quantum state is more complex than merely
    the probability of measuring 0 or 1, this method for determining and expressing an operation's
    functionality is insufficient.
  </p>
  <p> Now, use the circuit builder above to create the following circuits and observe the outcomes.
    This will reveal the functionality of the <c>Z</c> gate on a qubit in superposition.

  <p>
    Now we see that <c>Z</c> does have a major effect on the system, but <em>only</em> when the
    qubit is in superposition.
  </p>
  <p>
    We need a mathematical representation of phase that will allow us to perform operations
    to calculate results. We will express phase as positive (+) or negative (-).
    Starting with a qubit in the <m>\ket{0}</m> state results in positive (+) phase, and
    starting in <m>\ket{1}</m> state results in negative (-) phase.
  </p>
  <p>
    Likewise, if the qubit is already in the superposition 50/50 state, if it is in positive phase,
    applying an <c>H</c> gate will result in <m>\ket{0}</m>. An <c>H</c> gate applied to a qubit in the
    superposition 50/50 state in negative phase will result in <m>\ket{1}</m>.
    The truth table for the <c>Z</c> gate is below. I suggest adding this to your page of notes.
  </p>
  <insert>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      ISN'T THIS LAST SET OF STATEMENTS ONLY TRUE - AFTER MEASUREMENT?
      I thought applying a <c>Z</c> gate to a 50/50 w/ + phase would result in the <m>\ket{-}</m>
      state and a 50/50 qubit w/ - phase would result in the <m>\ket{+}</m> state. -jen</p>

    <insert>Insert two circuits for them to calculate the output. Don't do the entanglement gate - just
      some interesting versions of <c>NOT</c>, <c>SWAP</c>, <c>H</c>, and <c>Z</c> to play with going to the 50/50 state
      and
      returning
      to 0,1,
      or the <c>Z</c> gate making it flip. -Diana</insert>
