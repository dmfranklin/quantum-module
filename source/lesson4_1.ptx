     You might be thinking that we should have been able to easily tell the 
    difference between the random gate and the H gate by performing more 
    precise measurement after an H gate. That is, instead of just checking for 
    <m>\ket{0}</m> or <m>\ket{1}</m>, let's measure the probability and phase at the 
    same time!

<p> To better understand the situation, let's explore measurement in your daily life.</p>

<p> Measurement consists of a <insert>question</insert>, <insert>device</insert>, and <insert>method</insert>.</p>

     Consider measuring the length of a table.  
     <ul><li><b>Question:</b> How long is the table?</li>
     <li><b>Device:</b> A tape measure</li>
        <li><b>Method:</b> Place the tape measure along the length of the table and read the value.</li></ul>
    </p>

<p> This is a very straightforward measurement. The question is clear, the device is designed for this specific measurement, 
and the method is simple. Quantum processes are much more difficult to measure. </p>

<p><insert> Let's insert a question or two here having students identify the question, device, and method for a measurement scenario.
You can grab from the zines for fun examples. </insert></p>
