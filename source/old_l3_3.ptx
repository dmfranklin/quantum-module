<title>Probability</title>
<p> We have now introduced superposition and phase, but we don't have a way of precisely 
    calculating the effects. You know that starting with <m>|0\rangle</m> and applying an H gate 
    places the qubit in positive phase. Likewise, starting with <m>|1\rangle</m> and applying an H gate 
    places the qubit in negative phase. You also know that the Z gate flips the phase. While this is a start, 
    it is not sufficient for calculating the effect of the H and 
    Z gates on more complex states. We first need to have a better understanding of how to calculate 
    probabilities, then use those skills with a mathematical representation to calculate the effects of gates 
    on qubits in states of superposition and 
    phase. </p>

    <p> Let's explore a common use of probabilities - how we predict the weather. </p>

    <statement>
      <p>Look at this depiction of the probability of rain each hour of a single day in Chicago. Which 
        of the following are correct conclusions based on this information?
      </p>

    </statement>
    <choices randomize="no">
      <choice correct="yes">
        <statement><p>It is more likely to rain at 8am than 8pm.</p></statement>
        <feedback><p>Yes! We don't know whether it will rain at either time, but it is more likely 
            at 8am.
        </p></feedback>
      </choice>
      <choice>
        <statement><p>It is not going to rain at 11pm</p></statement>
        <feedback><p>While it is very unlikely to rain at 11pm, it still might.</p></feedback>
      </choice>
       <choice>
        <statement><p>It is  going to rain at 4am</p></statement>
        <feedback><p>While it is very likely to rain at 11pm, it still might not.</p></feedback>
      </choice>
    </choices>
    
  </exercise>

<p> So, what does probability really mean? Instead of telling you whether or not it is going to  
    rain, it tells you that if we experienced 100,000 days of exactly the same conditions as  
    today, 40,000 of those would likely have had rain at 4am. </p>  
    
   <p> Probability is not:  
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
               The prediction of a single outcome. 
            </p>
        </li>
                <li>
            <p>
               Confirmed or refuted based on the result of a single outcome. 
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
</p> 

       <p> Probability is:  
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
               The prediction of the frequency of an outcome in a set of many, many outcomes. 
            </p>
        </li>
                <li>
            <p>
               Confirmed or refuted based on the result of many, many identical experiments. 
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
