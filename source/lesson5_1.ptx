    <title>Basic Probability</title>

<p>
Let's begin by reviewing what probabilities about future events really mean. 
Look at the exercise below to see what you can conclude from a weather forecast.

        <choice  correct="yes">
          <statement>
            <p>It is more likely to rain in the morning than in the evening.
            </p>
          </statement>
          <feedback>
            <p>Yes! However, there is still a possibility that it rains in the evening and not the morning.</p>

      <hint>
        <p>Think carefully about what a forecast probability means.</p>
      </hint>
    </exercise>


<p>
What it really means is that if we experienced 100,000 days with these identical conditions,
approximately 40,000 of them would have rain at 4am. However, it does not make a definitive
statement about what is going to happen today.

Probability is not:
<ul><li>Knowledge about the outcome of any individual event</li>
<li>Confirmed or refuted through a single experiment</li>
</ul>
</p>
  <p>
Probability is:
<ul><li>A prediction of the frequency of an outcome of many, many actions
</li>
<li>Confirmed or refuted through many, many experiments</li>
</ul>
