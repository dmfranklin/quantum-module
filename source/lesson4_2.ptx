    <title>Heisenburg Uncertainty Principle</title>

<p> Now consider attempting to measure something more complex, like the current emotion of a baby? </p>

<p> Unless you are very experienced at reading babies, this measurement is much more difficult. 
While the question is clear, the device is not designed for this specific measurement, and the method is more complex. 
You might be able to make a good guess, but you might also be wrong. </p>
<p> <insert>There exists no precise way of measuring the emotion of a baby.</insert> It is not a question of finding
something else - there does not currently 
exist a measurement device that can give you a precise answer to the question of what a baby is feeling.</p>


<p> Likewise, <insert>measurement in quantum systems is limited in what information can be extracted in a single 
measurement </insert>; We are only able to measure one attribute of quantum state. We can choose to measure the number 
(<m>\ket{0}</m> vs. <m>\ket{1}</m>) or the phase (<m>\ket{+}</m> or <m>\ket{-}</m>). However, we are not able to 
measure the probabilities stored in the superposition state - we merely get a single outcome. </p>

<p> You might be thinking that, eventually, physicists or engineers will build such a precise device. Unfortunately,
the Heisenburg Uncertainty Principle states that it is impossible for such a device to exist. Quantum properties are 
stored in a single atom and represent the smallest particles known to exist. A measurement device needs to be able
to distinguish between different states, and that level of state is just too small to distinguish between.</p>

<p> What might programming look like in such a circumstance?</p>

<p> Consider storing variables in superposition. Below, we show a variable in superposition and two different
runs. This is only a hypothetical example - python will not accept this code.</p>

  <p> This example shows a similar limitation. In a quantum system, we would be able to store multiple
  values in the same variable, but whenever we perform a measurement (such as printing out the value), it 
  will only print out one of the values.</p>
