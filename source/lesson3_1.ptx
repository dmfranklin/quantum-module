      We now introduce a new gate: the Hadamard gate (also called the <c>H</c> gate).
      The <c>H</c> gate is a single qubit gate that places a qubit into <term>superposition</term>.

      We will use the circuit builder to learn more about superposition as we observe

<p> 
The key point is that when a qubit is in <b>superposition</b>, it does not have a definite value of 0 or 1. In fact,
it holds <i>both values simultaneously.</i>
In addition, it has probabilities of being measured as 0 or 1. The <c>H</c> gate creates this superposition by 
transforming the "basis" states <m>\ket{0}</m> and <m>\ket{1}</m> into equal superpositions of both states.
</p>
    <p>
      Now that you have observed the behavior of the <c>H</c> gate, you may want to write
      it on a page of notes or take a screenshot for future reference.

      Optical illusions are a great example of being two things at once. In the image below, some people see
      an old woman, and some see a young woman. The same person can see both images by shifting their perspective, 
      but never both at the same time.

 <p>
The phrase "wears many hats" is a good example of an analogy to superposition in our daily lives.
I hold many roles - I am a professor, colleague, researcher, advisor, mother, sister, friend, musician, etc. At 
different times, even within the same day, I play different roles when I interact with different people. However,
I am also simultaneously all of those things.
</p>

Jen: Make a new picture that is a single person, and they have different roles - professor, mother, friend, etc.
Me in the middle, a picture with each person around me. The other person has their label as to what they are 
compared to me (UG student, grad student, professor, mother, daughter, friend) and the arrow from me to them
is labeled with what I am to them.

<p>Both of these analogies have some similarities to quantum superposition - they hold multiple values, and 
the value observed depends on the context of the observation. However, they are not perfect analogies. Over the 
next two chapters, you will gain a much better understanding of the details of superposition in quantum systems.

  <title>Superposition Details</title>

<p> Before exploring superposition and the H gate further, we need to understand how to represent a 
state that is in superposition (and therefore has a probability of being measured as 0 or 1). We will start with the visual representation, 
and then in a later chapter, we will explore the mathematical representation.
</p>
 <sidebyside widths="75% 25%" valign="top">
    <p>
      First, it is important to understand that the 50/50 outcome of the H gate (when starting with a qubit in the <m>\ket{0}</m> or <m>\ket{1}</m> state)
       is not the only possible superposition state. A qubit can be in a superposition state with any probabilities of measuring 0 or 1, 
       as long as the probabilities add up to 100%. For example, a qubit could be in a superposition state where there is a 75% chance of 
       measuring 0 and a 25% chance of measuring 1, or vice versa.

  <p> So, how do we represent the state of a qubit that is in superposition? The interactive circuit widget uses a bar graph to visually represent the 
  probabilities of measuring 0 or 1. In order to more easily perform operations, we will represent the state as shown in the image below.
  <ul><li>
  There is a line in between each possible outcome.
  </li><li>
  The number of instances of the same color represents the probability of that outcome. For example, in the left image below, there is one white and one 
  black ball, so there is an equal probability of measuring 0 or 1. In the right image, there are three black and one white ball, so there is a 
  75% chance of measuring 1 (black) and a 25% chance of measuring 0 (white).

            <p>There are black balls in the state, so the probability of measuring black is non-zero,
