  <title>Exploring Superposition using the H Gate</title>
  <p>
    We now introduce a new gate - the Hadamard gate, or H gate. This is a single qubit gate that places a qubit in <i>superposition</i>.
    We will learn more about superposition as we observe how the H gate operates. Use the widget below to see what the H gate does to  
    a qubit that starts in the <m>|0\rangle</m> or <m>|1\rangle</m> state.

    Now that you have the full truth table for H, I suggest adding it onto your page of 
    notes for future reference. 
    </p>
    <p> Now let's explore what you observed - the H gate's output has an equal probability of measuring 0 or 1.
        This means that it appears to act like a <i>random</i> gate, producing random output. Imagine a random
        gate that did exactly that, then answer the next question. </p>

    </exercise>

Now let's look at what happens with an H gate! Use the widget below to check what happens when you start with <m>|0\rangle</m> or <m>|1\rangle</m> 
and you put two H gates in a row.

      visualizeProbabilitiesWidget({

        allowedGates: "XH"
      });

 <exercise label="Two_H_gates">
    <title>Two H gates</title>
    <idx>Two_H_gates</idx>
    <statement>
        <p>Which answer best describes what you observed from the H gate?
        </p>
    </statement>
    <choices randomize="yes">
     <choice correct="yes">
        <statement><p>It does not have an observable effect - they go back to their original values.</p></statement>
        <feedback><p>Look more closely at the bar graphs of the output.</p>
        </feedback>
      </choice>
      <choice correct="no">
        <statement><p>If the input is <m>|0\rangle</m> or <m>|1\rangle</m>, the result will have an equal chance 
            of measuring 0 or 1.
        </p></statement>
        <feedback><p>Make sure you put two H gates right next to each other.</p>
        </feedback>
      </choice>
          <choice correct="no">
        <statement><p>It has the same effect as a NOT gate</p></statement>
        <feedback><p>Make sure you put the H gates right next to each other.</p>
        </feedback>
      </choice>

    </choices>
    <hint><p>Use a NOT gate to make the second input 1, then put two H gates on each wire.</p></hint>
  </exercise>

  <p> By this point, I hope you have a big question in your mind - how is it that they are the same 
    value after the first H gate (that is, 50/50 probability of measuring 0 vs 1), yet the second gate 
    makes them go back to their original value? How can it distinguish between the 50/50 coming from 0 and 
    the 50/50 coming from 1? 
  </p>
  <p> What this means is that our current model is incomplete - there is some other element of quantum state that 
    we are not yet modeling! It is more complex than merely probability of measuring 0 vs 1. </p>
