  <title>Exploring Superposition with the <c>H</c> Gate</title>
  <sidebyside widths="75% 25%" valign="top">
    <p>
      We now introduce a new gate: the Hadamard gate (also called the <c>H</c> gate).
      The <c>H</c> gate is a single qubit gate that places a qubit into <term>superposition</term>.

      We will use the circuit builder to learn more about superposition as we observe
      how the <c>H</c> gate operates. Use the circuit builder below to see what the <c>H</c> gate
      does to a qubit that starts in the <m>\ket{0}</m> or <m>\ket{1}</m> state.

        Let's explore what you observed: the <c>H</c> gate's output has an equal probability of
        measuring 0 or 1. This means that it appears to act like a <em>random</em> gate—one that given an input of <m>
          \ket{0}</m> or <m>\ket{1}</m> would yield a
        random output.

      Imagine a <em>random</em> gate that does exactly that, then answer the next question.

      what happens when you start with <m>\ket{0}</m> or <m>\ket{1}</m> in a
      circuit with two <c>H</c> gates.

      </choices>
      <hint>
        <p>Use a <c>NOT</c> gate to make the second input <m>\ket{1}</m>, then put two <c>H</c> gates on each wire.
        </p>
      </hint>
    </exercise>

    <p>By this point, I hope you have a few big questions on your mind:</p>
    <ul>
      <!--
    <li>
      How is it that there is a 50/50 probability of measuring 0 vs 1 after the first <c>H</c> gate,
      yet a second <c>H</c> gate outputs the original value?
    </li>
-->
      <li>
        If there is a 50/50 chance of measuring 0 or 1 after the first <c>H</c> gate,
        then how is the original input value ALWAYS returned after the second <c>H</c> gate?
      </li>
      <li>
        How is a 50/50 probability coming from an input of <m>\ket{0}</m> distinguished
        from a 50/50 probability coming from an input of <m>\ket{1}</m>?
      </li>
      <!--
    <li>
      How is it that they are the same value after the first <c>H</c> gate (that is, 50/50 probability
      of measuring 0 vs 1), yet the second gate makes them go back to their original value?
    </li>
    <li>
      How can it distinguish between the 50/50 coming from 0 and the 50/50 coming from 1?
    </li>
-->
    </ul>
    <p>
      This means that our current model of <c>H</c> gate behavior is incomplete—there is some other
      element of quantum state that we are not yet modeling! It is more complex and holds
      more information than merely the probabilities of measuring 0 vs 1.
