  <title>Exploring Superposition with the H Gate</title>
  <sidebyside widths="75% 25%" valign="top"> 
    <p>
      We now introduce a new gate - the Hadamard gate (also called the H gate). 
      The H gate is a single qubit gate that places a qubit into <em>superposition</em>.

    <p>
    We will use the circuit builder to learn more about superposition as we observe 
    how the H gate operates. Use the circuit builder below to see what the H gate 
    does to a qubit that starts in the <m>|0\rangle</m> or <m>|1\rangle</m> state.

  <title>A Closer Look at the H Gate</title>

  <sidebyside widths="75% 10% 15%" valign="top"> 
    <p> 
    Let's explore what you observed - the H gate's output has an equal probability of 
    measuring 0 or 1. This means that it appears to act like a <em>random</em> gate -  
    one that given an input of <m>|0\rangle</m> or <m>|1\rangle</m> would yield a 
    random output.

      Imagine a <em>random</em> gate that does exactly that, then answer the next question.

      Now let's look at what happens with an H gate! Use the circuit builder to check 
      what happens when you start with <m>|0\rangle</m> or <m>|1\rangle</m> in a 
      circuit with two H gates.

  <p>By this point, I hope you have a few big questions on your mind - </p> 
  <ul>
<!--
    <li>
      How is it that there is a 50/50 probability of measuring 0 vs 1 after the first H gate, 
      yet a second H gate outputs the original value? 
    </li>
-->
    <li>
      If there is a 50/50 chance of measuring 0 or 1 after the first H gate, 
      then how is the original input value ALWAYS returned after the second H gate?
    </li>
    <li>  
      How is a 50/50 probability coming from an input of <m>|0\rangle</m> distinguished 
      from a 50/50 probability coming from an input of <m>|1\rangle</m>?
    </li>
<!--
    <li>
      How is it that they are the same value after the first H gate (that is, 50/50 probability 
      of measuring 0 vs 1), yet the second gate makes them go back to their original value? 
    </li>
    <li>
      How can it distinguish between the 50/50 coming from 0 and the 50/50 coming from 1?
    </li>
-->
  </ul> 
  <p>
    This means that our current model of H gate behavior is incomplete - there is some other 
    element of quantum state that we are not yet modeling! It is more complex and holds 
    more information than merely the probabilities of measuring 0 vs 1.
