      We now introduce a new gate: the Hadamard gate (also called the <c>H</c> gate).
      The <c>H</c> gate is a single qubit gate that places a qubit into <term>superposition</term>.

    <title>Exploring the <c>H</c> Gate</title>
    <p>
      We will use the circuit builder to learn more about superposition as we observe
      how the <c>H</c> gate operates. Use the circuit builder below to see what the <c>H</c> gate
      does to a qubit that starts in the <m>\ket{0}</m> or <m>\ket{1}</m> state. That is, 
      make the following two circuits and observe the outputs:

            <p>Correct! For an input of <m>\ket{0}</m> or <m>\ket{1}</m>, the output of
              an <c>H</c> gate will have an equal chance of measuring 0 or 1.</p>

      <hint>
        <p>Make the circuit and look at the bar graph below the circuit.
          Construct both input combinations using a <c>NOT</c> gate, recording the answers
          each time.</p>
      </hint>
    </exercise>

<p> 
The key point is that when a qubit is in <b>superposition</b>, it does not have a definite value of 0 or 1. In fact,
it holds <i>both values simultaneously</i>
Instead, it has probabilities of being measured as 0 or 1. The <c>H</c> gate creates this superposition by 
transforming the basis states <m>\ket{0}</m> and <m>\ket{1}</m> into equal superpositions of both states.
</p>
    <p>
      Now that you have observed the behavior of the <c>H</c> gate, you may want to write
      it on a page of notes or take a screenshot for future reference.

      Optical illusions are a great example of being two things at once. In the image below, some people see
      an old woman, and some see a young woman. The same person can see both images by shifting their perspective, 
      but never both at the same time.

 <p>
The phrase "wears many hats" is a good example of an analogy to superposition in our daily lives.
I hold many roles - I am a professor, colleague, researcher, advisor, mother, sister, friend, etc. At 
different times, even within the same day, I play different roles when I interact with different people.
</p>

Jen: Make a new picture that is a single person, and they have different roles - professor, mother, friend, etc.
Me in the middle, a picture with each person around me. The other person has their label as to what they are 
compared to me (UG student, grad student, professor, mother, daughter, friend) and the arrow from me to them
is labeled with what I am to them.

<p>Both of these analogies have some similarities to quantum superposition - they hold multiple values, and 
the value observed depends on the context of the observation. However, they are not perfect analogies. Over the 
next two chapters, you will gain a much better understanding of the details of superposition in quantum systems.
