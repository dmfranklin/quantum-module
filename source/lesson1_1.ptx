    Reading Circuits
  </title>
  <p>
    Quantum operations are visualized in what they call "circuits." Circuits are a visualization
    that depict the order of operations. Let's first see what some some familiar operations might look
    like if visualized like a circuit! 
   
  </p>

  <title>Cookie Circuits</title>
  
   (insert cookie circuit diagram with labels for start and end state, arrow from left to right
   saying order of operations)

        <datafile label="CookieCircuitOneOp" filename="CookieCircuitOneOp.png" include-source="yes">
            <image source="CookieCircuitOneOp.png" width="66%"/>
        </datafile>

  <p>
    In this picture, we begin with a plate of 3 cookies (the <em>input</em>). We have one operation, 
    "eat one cookie". After the operation is applied, we are left with two cookies. There is only
    one operation depicted, so that is the end of the program. Therefore, the plate with two cookies
    is the <em>output</em>. Likewise, if give the same circuit an input of a plate of 2 cookies and applied that operation
    once, we would end up with an output of a plate with 1 cookie.

  <exercise label="Cookie-Circuit-One-Plate">

        <p>How many cookies will be left after this Cookie Circuit runs?</p>

  <p> We can also draw a circuit that starts out with multiple plates of cookies
    and applies the operations to each plate. In this case, we start with two plates
    of cookies - one that has 5 cookies and the other that has 3. We then apply 
    operations to each of the plates. There are two operations applied to the plate
    with 5 cookies, and one operation applied to the plate with 3 cookies. We then 
    end up with plates of 3 and 2 cookies, respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
    Pick the circuit that has the 
    correct end state given the start state. (four circuit diagrams with 
    two starting plates of cookies (1-3 cookies) and one or two operations each time, only 
    one has a correct output given the starting input)

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Now let's consider how we would depict mathematical operations. 
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <p>
    We will use the following operations: 
    <ul>
    <li><p>Increment - add one to a number</p></li>
   <li><p> Decrement - subtract one from a number</p></li>
    <li><p>Negate - negate a number</p></li>
    <li><p>Add - add two numbers</p></li>
    </ul>
    

  </p>
  <p>
  (Subtraction is negation and addition)
  </p>
</section>

<p> Summary:
  <ul>
    <li><p>Circuits depict the order of operations. </p></li>
    <li><p>The order goes from left to right.</p></li>

    <li><p>Left to right depicts <em> order of operations, not physical movement</em>.</p></li>
    <li><p>Multiple items may be depicted in the same circuit.</p></li>
    <li><p>A single operation can involve multiple items.</p></li>
  </ul>
