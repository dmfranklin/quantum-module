<title>Phase</title>
<p>
  Phase is an additional attribute that is relevant when a qubit is in superposition. 
  In the last section, you saw that if you have a circuit with two consecutive H gates, 
  then the qubit goes into a superposition state after the <em>first</em> H gate, but then 
  it goes back to its original state after the <em>second</em> H gate. 
  When in a superposition state, the two qubits have opposite phase.

    Now we are going to explore a gate that affects the phase of the qubit.
    Use the following circuit to determine how the Z gate affects a qubit 
    that is in the state <m>|0\rangle</m> or <m>|1\rangle</m>.

  <p> 
    You might have been surprised by the answer! Because quantum state is more complex than merely
    the probability of measuring 0 or 1, this method for determining and expressing an operation's  
    functionality is insufficient. 
  </p>
  <p> Now, use the circuit builder above to create the following circuits and observe the outcomes. 
      This will reveal the functionality of the Z gate on a qubit in superposition.

    <p>
        Now we see that Z does have a major effect on the system, but <em>only</em> when the 
        qubit is in superposition. 
    </p>
    <p>    
        We need a mathematical representation of phase that will allow us to perform operations 
        to calculate results. We will express phase as positive (+) or negative (-). 
        Starting with a qubit in the <m>|0\rangle</m> state results in positive (+) phase, and 
        starting in <m>|1\rangle</m> state results in negative (-) phase. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Likewise, if the qubit is already in the superposition 50/50 state, if it is in positive phase, 
        applying an H gate will result in <m>|0\rangle</m>. An H gate applied to a qubit in the 
        superposition 50/50 state in negative phase will result in <m>|1\rangle</m>.
        The truth table for the Z gate is below. I suggest adding this to your page of notes.
    </p>
    <insert>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        ISN'T THIS LAST SET OF STATEMENTS ONLY TRUE - AFTER MEASUREMENT? 
        I thought applying a Z gate to a 50/50 w/ + phase would result in the <m>|-\rangle</m> 
        state and a 50/50 qubit w/ - phase would result in the <m>|+\rangle</m> state. -jen</p>

    <p> Insert two circuits for them to calculate the output. Don't do the entanglement gate - just 
        some interesting versions of NOT, SWAP, H, and Z to play with going to the 50/50 state and returning to 0,1, 
        or the Z gate making it flip. </p>
