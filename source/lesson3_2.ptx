<title>Randomness</title>

Before delving into the behavior we observed from the H gate, we need to 
clarify what we mean by "randomness" in the context of quantum mechanics.

In everyday language, "random" often implies a lack of pattern or predictability. 
We might use the word random in a few ways, with slightly different meanings:

<p><b>That was such a random comment!</b> <i> I found that comment completely unexpected!</i></p>

<p><b>The number was drawn at random!</b> <i> Each number was equally likely to be drawn!</i></p>

<p><b>Quantum measurements have random outcomes!</b> <i> The specific outcome is  unpredictable</i>
However, it does <b>not</b> mean that each outcome is equally likely. In quantum systems, we can 
have different probabilities for different outcomes, and those probabilities can be known. Random
merely specifies that the outcome of one specific measurement cannot be known - even if the 
probabilities are 99.9999999% for the first and 0.0000001% for the other.</p>

        Let's explore what you observed: the <c>H</c> gate's output has an equal probability of
        measuring 0 or 1. From only this information, you might make a few deductions:
        <ul>
          <li>
          Given an input of <m>\ket{0}</m> or <m>\ket{1}</m>, the outcome is entirely unpredictable.
          </li><li>
          It does not matter whether you input <m> \ket{0}</m> or <m>\ket{1}</m> - the end 
          state is the same either way.
          </li>   
        </ul>

      Imagine a <em>random</em> gate that does exactly that, then answer the next question.

      Now let's look at what happens with an <c>H</c> gate! Use the circuit builder to check
      what happens when you start with <m>\ket{0}</m> or <m>\ket{1}</m> in a
      circuit with two <c>H</c> gates.

      </choices>
      <hint>
        <p>Use a <c>NOT</c> gate to make the second input <m>\ket{1}</m>, then put two <c>H</c> gates on each wire.
        </p>
      </hint>
    </exercise>

    <p>By this point, I hope you have a few big questions on your mind:</p>
    <ul>
      <!--
    <li>
      How is it that there is a 50/50 probability of measuring 0 vs 1 after the first <c>H</c> gate,
      yet a second <c>H</c> gate outputs the original value?
    </li>
-->
      <li>
        If there is a 50/50 chance of measuring 0 or 1 after the first <c>H</c> gate,
        then how is the original input value ALWAYS returned after the second <c>H</c> gate?
      </li>
      <li>
        How is a 50/50 probability coming from an input of <m>\ket{0}</m> distinguished
        from a 50/50 probability coming from an input of <m>\ket{1}</m>?
      </li>
      <!--
    <li>
      How is it that they are the same value after the first <c>H</c> gate (that is, 50/50 probability
      of measuring 0 vs 1), yet the second gate makes them go back to their original value?
    </li>
    <li>
      How can it distinguish between the 50/50 coming from 0 and the 50/50 coming from 1?
    </li>
-->
    </ul>
    <p>
      This means that our current model of <c>H</c> gate behavior is incomplete—there is some other
      element of quantum state that we are not yet modeling! It is more complex and holds
      more information than merely the probabilities of measuring 0 vs 1.
