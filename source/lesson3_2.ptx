  <title>Phase</title>
  <p>
    Phase is an additional attribute that is relevant when a qubit is in superposition. 
    In the last section, you saw that if you have a circuit with two H gates, then the 
    qubit goes into superposition in the middle, but then it goes back to its original 
    state after the second H gate. When in superposition, the two qubits have opposite
    phase.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now we are going to explore a gate that affects the phase of the qubit.
  </p>

 Use the following circuit to determine how the Z gate affects a qubit that is in the 
 state <m>|0\rangle</m> or <m>|1\rangle</m>.

    <statement>
        <p>Which answer best describes what you observed from the Z gate?

  </exercise>
  <p> 
    You might have been surprised by the answer! Because quantum state is more complex than merely
    the probability of measuring 0 or 1, this method for determining and expressing an operation's  
    functionality is insufficient. 
    </p>
    <p> Now create the following circuit and observe the outcomes. This will reveal the functionality 
        of the Z gate on a qubit in superposition.

    <p> Insert a picture that shows two qubits - one with H-Z-H and one with NOT-H-Z-H </p>

    </exercise>

    <p>Now  we see that Z does have a major effect on the system, but only when the 
        qubit is in superposition. We need a mathematical representation of phase that 
        will allow us to perform operations to calculate results. We will express phase as 
        positive ('+') or negative ('-'). The truth table for the Z gate is below. I suggest 
        adding this to your page of notes. Putting a qubit starting in <m>|0\rangle</m> results 
        in positive phase, and starting in <m>|1\rangle</m> results in negative phase. Likewise, 
        if the qubit is already in the superposition 50/50 state, if it is in positive phase, applying 
        an H gate will result in <m>|0\rangle</m>. An H gate applied to a qubit in the superposition 50/50 state 
        in negative phase will result in <m>|1\rangle</m>.
    </p>

    <p> insert image of the Z gate truth table </p>

    <p> Insert two circuits for them to calculate the output. Don't do the entanglement gate - just 
        some interesting versions of NOT, SWAP, H, and Z to play with going to the 50/50 state and returning to 0,1, 
        or the Z gate making it flip. </p>
