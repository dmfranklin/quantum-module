    <title>Building Quantum Circuits</title>
    <introduction>
    <p>Quantum computing operations harness quantum properties to have outputs that 
    are not possible with classical computers. For this reason, we represent quantum
    programs and quantum state differently than in classical computing.</p>
    
    <p>In this part of the lesson, we will learn some basic quantum operations that can 
    be implented by classical computers and introduce
    a drag-and-drop tool (Q.js) you can use to build build quantum circuits. In future lessons,
    you will use this tool to explore the behavior of quantum operations that cause properties 
    not possible with classical computers.</p>

    <title>Qubit: A quantum bit</title>
    <p> Grace Hopper invented the compiler, which allowed programmers to often ignore the 1's 
    and 0's in the machine and use higher level languages. Unfortunately, the unique features
    of quantum computing reveal themselves on single bits, and algorithms are still designed
    at the bit level. Therefore, we will operate on single bits, not integers or larger numbers. 
    </p>
    <p> A quantum bit, or qubit, holds a 0 or 1, just like a classical bit. However, a single
    qubit also holds other interesting information that we will explore throughout this course. 
    Today, we will only use the 0 and 1. To go along with the more complex state, the representation
    uses slightly different syntax. We will begin that now - instead of just writing 0 or 1, we will
    write |0⟩ and |1⟩. Later, we will learn more about what those symbols mean. 
    </p>
    <p> To make it easier to visualize, we will use a white ball for |0⟩ and a black ball for |1⟩.</p>

<section xml:id="sec-not">
    <title>Q Gate #1: NOT</title>
    <p> Quantum operations are called <em>gates</em>. The simplest operation is the 
    NOT, or X, gate. From a classical perspective, it toggles the value between 0 and 1.
    That is, if the input is 0, the output is 1, and vice versa.</p>

    <title>Build a Quantum Circuit</title>
    <p> In this section, we introduce the interactive quantum circuit builder.</p>
    <p>There are three operations that operate well on qubits in simple states |0⟩ and |1⟩:NOT, SWAP, and CNOT</p>
    <image source="NOT-SWAP-CNOT.png" width="60%"/>

    <p>
    Below is your first circuit to build using the circuit builder's explore mode. 
    Drag and drop the pictures of the gates onto the 
    circuit. In explore mode, every time you make a change, it provides
    feedback. You can ignore the feedback until you think you are done!!
    </p>
    <p>
    The SWAP gate is a two-qubit gate, which will be two diamonds in this widget.
    Place the two diamonds on the two wires in the same column. Click on them so   
    they are both highlighted, then click on the "S" button to connect them.
    </p>

    <interactive aspect="9:9" platform="javascript" source="../../../source/loader.js">
      <script>
        identicalCircuitWidget({
          circuit: "L1_2_1",
          instantFeedback: true,
          allowedGates: "XS"
        });
      </script>
    </interactive>

<p>
    Now let's try building a circuit with a controlled gate - just like the controlled
    increment we saw in the math example. Put a spot on one the control wire and the gate on the 
    target wire. Click on them to make sure they are both highlighted, then click the "C" button 
    to connect them.
</p>

  <interactive aspect="9:9" platform="javascript" source="../../../source/loader.js">
      <script>
        identicalCircuitWidget({
          circuit: "L1_2_2",
          instantFeedback: true,
          allowedGates: "X*"
        });
      </script>
    </interactive>
  <p>
  <insert>  I am leaving in this last one because it had a bug when I tried it - it always
    said I was not correct, even when I completed the circuit.</insert>
  </p>
   <interactive aspect="9:9" platform="javascript" source="../../../source/loader.js">
      <script>
        identicalCircuitWidget({
          circuit: "Phi+",
          instantFeedback: true,
          allowedGates: "HX*"
        });
      </script>
