    <title>Probability</title>
    <p> We have now introduced superposition and phase, but we don't have a way of precisely
        calculating the effects. You know that starting with <m>\ket{0}</m> and applying an <c>H</c> gate
        places the qubit in positive phase. Likewise, starting with <m>\ket{1}</m> and applying an <c>H</c> gate
        places the qubit in negative phase. You also know that the <c>Z</c> gate flips the phase. While this is a start,
        it is not sufficient for calculating the effect of the <c>H</c> and
        <c>Z</c> gates on more complex states. We first need to have a better understanding of how to calculate
        probabilities, then use those skills with a mathematical representation to calculate the effects of gates
        on qubits in states of superposition and
        phase.
