  <title>Superposition and Gates</title>

<p>
Now you need to know how to calculate the outputs of gates when the 
inputs are in superposition, beyond memorizing that two H gates to into
superposition and then out again. This requires two pieces of knowledge:
<ul><li> How to visualize two qubit state</li>
<li> How to calculate the outcome when inputs are in superposition</li></ul>
</p>

    <title>Visualizing two-qubit state</title>

    <p> As we learned before, the horizontal line divides between two different
    possible outcomes. If there is no line, then two different qubits are being
    represented. In the images below, the left side is a single qubit in 
    50/50 superposition. The right side is two different qubits, one  
    <m>\ket{0}</m>  and the other  <m>\ket{1}</m>.</p>
