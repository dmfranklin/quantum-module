    <title>Lingering Effects</title>

<p> You might be thinking that the previous limitation was not *too* bad.
All we need to do to measure the state is to perform 1000 consecutive 
measurements, and that will extract approximate probabilities of each outcome.
Unfortunately, there is a second limitation of quantum measurement.</p>

<p> Consider measuring the temperature of a cup of hot chocolate.</p>  
<sidebyside widths="75% 25%" valign="top">
    <p>
     <ul><li><b>Question:</b> What is the temperature of the hot chocolate?</li>
     <li><b>Device:</b> A thermometer</li>
        <li><b>Method:</b> Place the thermometer in the hot chocolate and read the value.</li></ul>
    </p>
    <image source="hotchocolate.png" width="66%" />
  </sidebyside>

  <p> What would happen, though, if we chose a different measurement device and method? 
  Instead, let's imagine measuring the temperature of a cup of hot chocolate by timing how long 
  it takes for the hot chocolate to melt an ice cube.
    <ul><li><b>Question:</b> What is the temperature of the hot chocolate?</li>
         <li><b>Device:</b> A stopwatch</li>
            <li><b>Method:</b> Place an ice cube in the hot chocolate and time how long it takes to melt.</li></ul>
</p>

<p><insert>Put in a checkpoint question asking what the effect would be of this measurement method</insert></p>

    <p> This is a very different measurement device and method, but it can still give us information 
    about the temperature of the hot chocolate. Is there any downside to this method? Does someone still want to 
    drink the hot chocolate after the ice cube has cooled it down?
    </p>






<p><insert>In quantum systems, the measurement changes the state of the measured qubit.</insert> More specifically,
if the qubit is in superposition, then the measurement will cause it to lose its superposition, and it will 
hold the same value as the measured outcome. </p>



<p>If we were to consider what this would mean in python, it would
look like the following for the code on the left and two different runs of the code on the right: </p>

<sidebyside widths="50% 25% 25%" valign="top">
    
    <image source="4_3_python1.png" width="66%" />
    <image source="4_3_pyoutput_1.png" width="66%" />
    <image source="4_3_pyoutput_2.png" width="66%" />
  </sidebyside>

  <p> Once we print out the variable the first time, every subsequent print statement will print out the same think
  unless more operations are performed on the variable to place it back into superposition.</p>



<p> We can also apply this to our one qubit system with H gates. Now we have a much more complete
picture of what was happening:</p>
<p>  <image source="L4.3-H-gate-state-output.png" width="66%" /> </p>

<p> To really challenge our understanding at this point, let's consider the following circuit and use 
it to answer a few checkpoint questions:</p>

<p><insert> Ask what the state is leaving the first H gate, then describe the outcome of 
the first measurement. Then describe what state the qubit is in. Then ask what the state is after the 
second H gate and what the outcome of the measurement would be. The picture below can be used 
for the last two questions.</insert></p>
