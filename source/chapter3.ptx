  <title>Exploring Quantum Operations</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>In this chapter, we are going to learn about superposition, which introduces <i>probabilistic gates</i>. Specifically, we have the following learning goals:

What is going on with these probabilistic gates?
How do we represent the probabilistic output visually?
How do we represent the probabilistic output mathematically?
How can we calculate these probabilities as they pass through other gates?
