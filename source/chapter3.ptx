  <title>Superposition</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this chapter, we are going to learn about superposition, which introduces <term>probabilistic gates</term>.
      Specifically, we have the following learning goals:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>What is going on with these probabilistic gates?</li>
      <li>How do we represent the probabilistic output <em>visually</em>?</li>
      <li>How do we represent the probabilistic output <em>mathematically</em>?</li>
      <li>How can we calculate these probabilities as they pass through other gates?</li>
    </ul>
